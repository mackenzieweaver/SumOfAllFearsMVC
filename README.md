# SumOfAllFearsMVC
 
![Solution Page](https://github.com/mackenzieweaver/SumOfAllFearsMVC/blob/main/SumOfAllFearsMVC/sumofallfearsmvc.png)

### Why did I make Sum of all fears, again...?

Because this time it's built with ASP.NET Core MVC.

### The live site

The site is not live because it has not been hosted and/or deployed anywhere.

### Download

But you can clone this repo

`git clone https://github.com/mackenzieweaver/SumOfAllFearsMVC`
